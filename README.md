Communicating Data Science Results project 1


The files in this repository contain my work for the Communicating Data Science course project on crime in San Francisco and Seattle.
A summary can be found in the .pdf file or can be viewed via the .md directly on github.
The work was done using R and the included .Rmd can be used to reproduce the work in any R environment that has all the required packages installed.
